Plus Jakarta Sans is the primary typeface used throughout the application. It's a modern, geometric sans-serif that offers excellent readability across all screen sizes and maintains a professional yet approachable feel.

For hero headlines and page titles, use text-5xl to text-6xl with font-extrabold (800 weight) to create strong visual impact. Section headings should use text-2xl to text-3xl with font-bold (700 weight), while card titles and subheadings work best at text-lg to text-xl with font-semibold (600 weight).

Body text and paragraphs should remain at text-base with font-normal (400 weight) for optimal reading comfort. For buttons, labels, and navigation items, use font-medium (500 weight) to provide subtle emphasis without overpowering. Secondary text, captions, and metadata should use text-sm with text-muted-foreground color, while badges and timestamps can go down to text-xs.

Always use semantic color tokens: text-foreground for primary content, text-muted-foreground for secondary information, text-primary for interactive or branded elements, and the text-gradient utility class for decorative headlines that need extra visual punch.
